## 🚀 Recent Improvements

### Phase 0: Security Hardening (COMPLETED ✅)
1. **Cryptographic Security**
   - Replaced `Math.random()` with `crypto.randomInt()` for room codes
   - Implemented secure file naming with `crypto.randomBytes(16)`

2. **Privacy Protection**
   - Added EXIF metadata stripping from photos
   - Prevents GPS coordinates and device info leakage

3. **Production Safety**
   - Fail-fast validation for Cloudinary credentials
   - Environment-specific security checks

### Phase 1: Code Refactoring (COMPLETED ✅)
1. **Architecture**
   - Reduced main server.js from 1,038 to 580 lines (44% reduction)
   - Created modular structure with separation of concerns

2. **New Directory Structure**
   ```
   backend/src/
   ├── config/      # Configuration (Cloudinary, Multer)
   ├── middleware/  # Rate limiters
   ├── models/      # GameRoom class
   ├── services/    # File cleanup
   └── utils/       # Helper functions
   ```

3. **Testing**
   - Implemented Jest testing framework
   - 55 unit tests (100% passing)
   - Tests cover security functions and business logic
