# Critical Security Fixes - Photo Blender

## Date: 2025-11-01

This document summarizes the critical security vulnerabilities that were identified and fixed.

---

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. Race Condition in Room Code Generation (CRITICAL)
**Status**: FIXED
**Location**: `backend/server.js:109-121`

**Issue**: Two simultaneous requests could potentially get the same room code due to race condition between checking `gameRooms.has(roomCode)` and `gameRooms.set()`.

**Fix**: Refactored to atomically check and set the room code within the same conditional block, minimizing the race window.

```javascript
// Before: do-while with separate check and set
// After: while loop with immediate set on successful check
while (attempts < MAX_ATTEMPTS) {
  roomCode = generateRoomCode();
  if (!gameRooms.has(roomCode)) {
    gameRoom = new GameRoom(roomCode);
    gameRooms.set(roomCode, gameRoom); // Immediate set
    break;
  }
}
```

### 2. Insecure Photo Shuffling (SECURITY)
**Status**: FIXED
**Location**: `backend/src/models/GameRoom.js:84-90`

**Issue**: Used `Math.random()` for photo shuffling, which is NOT cryptographically secure. Could potentially allow prediction of photo order.

**Fix**: Replaced with `crypto.randomInt()` for cryptographically secure randomness.

```javascript
// Before: Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1))
// After: crypto.randomInt(0, i + 1)
```

---

### 3. Missing FRONTEND_URL Validation (CRITICAL)
**Status**: FIXED
**Location**: `backend/server.js:34-42`

**Issue**: CORS origin defaulted to localhost if `FRONTEND_URL` was not set in production, potentially allowing unauthorized cross-origin requests.

**Fix**: Added strict validation that throws an error if `FRONTEND_URL` is not set in production.

```javascript
const FRONTEND_URL = process.env.FRONTEND_URL ||
  (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? (() => { throw new Error('FRONTEND_URL must be set in production'); })()
    : "http://localhost:3000");
```

---

### 4. Missing Security Headers (CRITICAL)
**Status**: FIXED
**Location**: `backend/server.js:48-65`

**Issue**: No security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, etc.) were set, leaving the app vulnerable to clickjacking and XSS.

**Fix**: Added Helmet.js with comprehensive Content Security Policy.

```javascript
app.use(helmet({
  contentSecurityPolicy: {
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["'self'"],
      imgSrc: ["'self'", "data:", "https://res.cloudinary.com"],
      // ... more directives
    }
  }
}));
```

**Dependencies Added**: `helmet@^7.2.0`

---

### 5. Unrestricted Total Upload Size (CRITICAL - DoS Risk)
**Status**: FIXED
**Location**: `backend/server.js:191-215`, `backend/src/models/GameRoom.js`

**Issue**: 10MB per file limit existed, but NO total limit per player or room. A malicious user could upload 20 photos × 10MB = 200MB per player, causing disk space exhaustion.

**Fix**: Added tracking and limits for:
- **Per Player**: 100MB total upload size
- **Per Room**: 500MB total upload size

```javascript
const MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_PER_PLAYER = 100 * 1024 * 1024; // 100MB
const MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE_PER_ROOM = 500 * 1024 * 1024; // 500MB
```

**Changes**:
- Added `totalUploadSize` to GameRoom model
- Added `totalUploadSize` to player objects
- Track compressed file size (not original upload size)
- Validate before accepting uploads

---

### 6. Missing WebSocket Authentication (CRITICAL)
**Status**: FIXED
**Location**: `backend/server.js:533-549`, `backend/server.js:174-183`

**Issue**: WebSocket connections had NO authentication. Any client could connect and emit events with fake `playerId` values, impersonate other players, and manipulate game state.

**Fix**: Implemented JWT-based WebSocket authentication system.

**Flow**:
1. Client joins room via `POST /api/join-room`
2. Server generates JWT token with `playerId`, `roomCode`, `playerName`
3. Client receives token and uses it to authenticate WebSocket connection
4. Server validates token via Socket.IO middleware
5. Verified info is attached to socket object
6. All socket events validate client data matches authenticated data

```javascript
// JWT token generation on join
const token = jwt.sign(
  { playerId, roomCode, playerName },
  JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: '24h' }
);

// WebSocket authentication middleware
io.use((socket, next) => {
  const token = socket.handshake.auth.token;
  const decoded = jwt.verify(token, JWT_SECRET);
  socket.playerId = decoded.playerId;
  socket.roomCode = decoded.roomCode;
  socket.playerName = decoded.playerName;
  next();
});
```

**Security Additions**:
- JWT_SECRET environment variable (required in production)
- Token expiration (24 hours)
- PlayerId validation in socket events
- RoomCode validation in socket events
- Additional playerId validation in HTTP endpoints (`/api/submit-guess`)

**Dependencies Added**: `jsonwebtoken@^9.0.2`

## Environment Variables Required

### Production Environment Variables (MANDATORY)
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com  # REQUIRED in production
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-random-secret-here      # REQUIRED in production (min 32 chars)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret
```

### Development (Optional)
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
# FRONTEND_URL defaults to http://localhost:3000
# JWT_SECRET auto-generated for development
```

## Testing

All 55 existing unit tests continue to pass:
- ✅ 16 tests for helper functions (XSS prevention, room code generation)
- ✅ 39 tests for GameRoom model
- ✅ No regressions introduced

---

## Frontend Changes Required

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The frontend must be updated to support WebSocket authentication.

### Required Changes:

1. **Store JWT token from join-room response**:
```typescript
const response = await axios.post('/api/join-room', { roomCode, playerName });
const { token, playerId, ...rest } = response.data;
localStorage.setItem('authToken', token);
```

2. **Use token for WebSocket connection**:
```typescript
const socket = io(BACKEND_URL, {
  auth: {
    token: localStorage.getItem('authToken')
  }
});
```

3. **Handle authentication errors**:
```typescript
socket.on('connect_error', (error) => {
  if (error.message.includes('token')) {
    // Redirect to join page or show error
  }
});
```

---

## Migration Notes

### Breaking Changes
- WebSocket connections now require JWT authentication
- Frontend MUST send `auth.token` in Socket.IO handshake
- Old clients without token support will be rejected

### Backward Compatibility
- HTTP endpoints remain compatible
- Existing localStorage data (playerId, roomCode) still used
- Rate limiters unchanged

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. ✅ Set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable
2. ✅ Set `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
3. ⚠️ Update frontend to use JWT authentication
4. Test WebSocket authentication flow end-to-end
5. Generate and securely store JWT_SECRET (use `openssl rand -hex 64`)

### Recommended (High Priority)
- Add input validation middleware with express-validator
- Implement centralized error handling
- Add structured logging (Winston/Pino)
- Add WebSocket rate limiting
- Migrate backend to TypeScript

### Nice to Have
- Add integration tests
- Create .env.example file
- Implement graceful shutdown
- Add health check dependencies verification
